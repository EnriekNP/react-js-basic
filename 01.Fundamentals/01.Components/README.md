# Component
## What is a Component in React?
A component is a piece of the user interface(UI) in React. Each component has its own look and its own behavior. Components can be really small, like a single button, or much larger, like a full page.

The main idea of components is to break down a big application into smaller, manageable pieces. This way, each piece is easy to understand, update, and use in different places if needed.

### **EXERCISE**
1. **Create a Greet Component**
   - Create a new file called `Greet.jsx` and inside that file, write a `Greet` component using the **function declaration** syntax.
   - Afterward, refactor the `Greet` component to use the **arrow function** syntax.
   - Finally, register the `Greet` component in your `App.jsx` file so that you can see the result when running the app.

### **Expected Outcome**
When running the app, you should see the `Greet` component displayed, showing a message (like a welcome message) on the screen.
